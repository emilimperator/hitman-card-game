# Hitman Card Game

A two-player survival card game built in Java for the Java Programming Practice course at Sungkyunkwan University, Spring 2026. Inspired by Exploding Kittens, the game features a full Swing GUI, local two-player mode, and TCP/IP networked multiplayer with a multithreaded server.

## Overview

Players take turns drawing cards from a shared deck. Drawing a Hitman card eliminates the player — unless they hold an Angel card, in which case the Hitman is reinserted into the deck at a position of the player's choosing. The last player alive wins.

## Features

- **9 unique card types** with distinct effects
- **Local mode** — two players share one screen and take turns
- **Network mode** — host or join a game over LAN using TCP/IP
- **Multithreaded server** handling both clients simultaneously
- **Persistent leaderboard** stored in CSV format
- **Custom exceptions** for invalid game states
- **Colorful Swing UI** with card-game-table aesthetics

## Card Types

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Hitman | Draw it = you are eliminated (unless you hold an Angel) |
| Angel | Cancels a drawn Hitman; the holder chooses where it goes back |
| Skip | Skip your turn without drawing |
| Future | Peek at the top 3 cards of the deck |
| Bomb | Force a target to take 2 turns (stackable with counter-Bomb) |
| Take Card | Steal a card — the target chooses which to give |
| Stop | Cancel an action card used against you |
| Shuffle | Fully randomize the deck |
| Take Bottom | Draw from the bottom of the deck instead of the top |

## How to Run

### Requirements
- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Eclipse IDE (recommended) or any Java IDE

### Running in Eclipse
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Eclipse → File → Import → General → Existing Projects into Workspace
3. Select the `Hitman_Card_Game` folder
4. Right-click `Main.java` → Run As → Java Application

### Running from the command line
```bash
cd Hitman_Card_Game/src
javac hitman/*.java
java hitman.Main
```

## How to Play (Network Mode)

**Both players must be on the same WiFi network.**

### Host:
1. Run the game and click "Network Game"
2. Enter your name
3. Click "Host Game" — the screen will show "Waiting for opponent..."
4. Share your local IP address with the other player

### Join:
1. Run the game and click "Network Game"
2. Enter your name and the host's IP address
3. Click "Join Game"

Once both players are connected, the game begins automatically.

## Technical Highlights

- **Object-Oriented Design** — Abstract `Card` class with 9 polymorphic subclasses
- **Encapsulation** — All game state hidden behind public methods
- **Exception Handling** — Custom checked exceptions for game logic errors
- **File I/O** — Try-with-resources for safe leaderboard CSV reading/writing
- **Multithreading** — One reader thread per client on the server
- **Plain-text protocol** — Easy to debug network messages
